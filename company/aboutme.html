      <p>You want to capture the moments that are the most important to you. You want the living memories of your life to stay still and be held.</p>
      <h4>That's what I want, too.</h4>
      <p>I've had over a decade of experience in capturing the these moments in the most authentic way possible. I specialize in natural light, candid photography. I want you to be able to see and feel the magic in every photo, and keep these memories with you forever.</p>
      <p>My technique is simple. I like to get comfortable. I like to spend time with you, create an environment where you can be yourself and let you create your own magic.</p>
      <p>Minimal posing. Minimal posturing. Simply memories captured by me and held by you.</p>
